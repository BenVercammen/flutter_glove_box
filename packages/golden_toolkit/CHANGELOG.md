# Changelog

## 0.1.0-dev

Initial release. Includes utility methods for easily pumping complex widgets, loading real fonts, and for writing more advanced Golden-based tests.

Features

- `GoldenBuilder` for widget integration tests that visually indicate different states of a widgets in a single Golden test.
- `multiScreenGolden` for pumping a widget and performing multiple Golden assertions with different device characteristics (e.g. screen size, accessibility options, etc)

_We expect to make breaking changes over the next few releases as we stabilize the API._
